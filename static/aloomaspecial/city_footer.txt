                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:medium;">What is your sanitation process between rentals?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Every unit returned to our yard undergoes a rigorous multi-step sanitation process. We start by professionally pumping the holding tank, then pressure wash the entire interior and exterior with a high-grade disinfectant cleaner. We finish by restocking all supplies and conducting a final quality inspection to ensure itâ€™s delivered in like-new condition.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">What factors should I consider besides guest count when deciding on the number of units?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Event duration is a key factor; the longer the event, the more units you'll need. You should also consider whether alcohol is being served, as this typically increases restroom usage by 30-40%. Finally, a higher ratio of female to male guests may warrant additional units to reduce wait times.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">My event runs into the evening. What are my options for restroom lighting?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">We have several solutions! For standard or deluxe units in #State, we offer small, battery-powered interior LED lights that can be added to any potty rental. For a more premium experience, our VIP units and all our restroom trailer models come with built-in interior and exterior lighting.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">Is a special water hookup required for the shower and restroom combo trailer?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">No, our trailers are fully self-contained. They come equipped with large-capacity onboard freshwater tanks and waste holding tanks. All they require is access to a standard power source to run the water pump and lights, which we can also supply with a generator if needed.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">Are there any hidden fees in your porta potty rental cost, like delivery or taxes?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">We believe in 100% transparency. The quote we provide you will be a clear, itemized breakdown that includes the rental fee, a standard delivery and pickup charge, and any applicable taxes. There are no surprise fees or hidden surcharges.</p>
